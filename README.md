# Generic iOS App

I co-created a services platform for businesses to use IoT devices in their storefronts.  
As of late 2019 I've stopped working on this project. A lot of technical work was done for it, part of it was an iOS iPhone App I wrote. I've decided to open-source a generic version of the app and keep the BLE capability.

The IoT technology that this app uses are BLE iBeacons, see [Apple's docs](https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/). If you don't own a beacon, you can still run this app with test data that is included.

# Getting Started
